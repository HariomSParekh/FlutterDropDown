Flutter Tutorials - Flutter DropdownButton with Firestore Video series can be watched here https://youtu.be/pAn3-cqJ9MM

## Getting Started

we will see how to implement a dropdown feature in your Flutter Application and the available items in the dropdown
 are not static, in fact, they are retrieved from the Firestore.
 
 
 You can watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R12ks4yDpMM for details explanation on setting up a project on Firebase console.

The Cloud Firestore plugin details are available in this link
